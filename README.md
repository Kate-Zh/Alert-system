# Alert-system
academic project to practice building an alert system
This project was made for social network mobile app.
The script tracks the values of the most important product metrics for the news: DAU, CTR, likes and views.
A method of anomaly detection based on the calculation of interquartile ranges was chosen for this system.
It is automated with Gitlab CI/CD and telegram bot.
